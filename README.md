## Projects

### [Credit Risk Prediction](Default-Prediction/README.md)

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict credit risk, classifying new customers as either "good payers" or "defaulters." The primary objective is to significantly **reduce false negatives** (identifying a defaulter as a good payer) due to their substantial financial impact on companies. After evaluating several models, a **Tuned Decision Tree** emerged as the best performer, demonstrating superior accuracy and recall in identifying high-risk customers, thereby providing a more reliable credit assessment.

**Models tested:** `Logistic Regression`, `Tuned Decison Tree`

### [Fraud Detection Project](Fraud-Prediction/README.md)

This project is dedicated to developing a predictive model for detecting fraudulent transactions within a large dataset. The core aim is to **minimize fraud** and **maximize company profits** by being more conservative in transaction approvals. Through extensive data analysis, feature engineering, and testing various models, a **Decision Tree** was identified as the most effective solution. This model successfully reduced the fraud rate and led to a notable increase in profit compared to the previous baseline.

**Models tested:** `Logistic Regression`, `Decison Tree`, `Random Forest`, `XGBoost`, `Naive Bayes`, `KNN`.
